COMPUTING - MACHINE

Overview
This project comprises two Python programs designed to simulate different stochastic processes using custom implementations of the exponential random variable. The first program, question1.py, generates a sequence of processes with inter-arrival times and service durations based on given rates, useful in systems modeling and performance evaluation. The second program, question2.py, simulates a failure and restoration process over a specified period, applicable in reliability engineering and maintenance planning.

Getting Started
To use these programs, ensure you have a basic understanding of Python and stochastic processes. The programs are standalone and do not require external libraries beyond Python's standard library.

Requirements
Python 3.6 or newer
Installation
No installation is required other than having Python installed on your system. Download the Python files to a directory of your choice.

Running the Programs
For question1.py: This program can be run from the command line. Navigate to the directory containing the file and run:
python question1.py

For question2.py: Similarly, run this program via the command line:
python question2.py

Comparing the Programs
While both programs utilize the exponential distribution for stochastic simulation, question1.py focuses on process arrival and service times, ideal for queueing theory applications. In contrast, question2.py simulates equipment failures over time, making it suitable for reliability and maintenance studies.

Testing
To test these programs, run them with various parameters and verify the output against expected theoretical results or other simulation tools.

System Requirements
Operating System: Windows, macOS, or Linux
Python version: 3.6 or newer
Ensure your system meets these requirements for optimal performance of the simulations.
